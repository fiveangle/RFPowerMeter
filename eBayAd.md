RF Power Meter 27 144 433 868 915 1200 2400 5800 mhz open source Arduino ad8319 (AD8317 series)


This not only RF Power meter.
You can also find any RF Source by using Geiger counter sound effect by internal Buzzer And trim you antennas in raw mode.

This is Batch â„–7 have more accurately calibration.

Calibration menu
Press Down button and UP Button AND power on
Open terminal windows at 57600, press enter.
backup all first!
Device is already factory calibrated!
You do this At Your Own Risk!


Yes it is open source,
you can flash any you want, but not use EEPROM in Arduino, else you can lost factory calibration data.

It is hard to measure very accurate on 1GHz band and up-
very sensitive to clean connector, cable tight, hand orientation, temperature and over.
It is hobby stuff, not 10k$ lab)
Changing environmental conditions also make it hard to measure.

We have two version of attenuator: gold and silver.  Quality the same, both 30dBm.
So, we ship random model.


Please note: 
We ship orders once a week, regular on Wednesdays.
We have small batch every 2-3 weeks.
